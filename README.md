An intelligent, extensible customer support agent for airline-related inquiries, built on the **Qwen-Agent** framework. This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and custom tools to deliver conversational support for common airline questions.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The agent understands natural language, interacts with simulated airline APIs, and provides helpful, human-like responses.

---

## Features

- **Flight Status Checking:** Get real-time updates on flight status (e.g., "On Time," "Delayed," "Cancelled").
- **Flight Search:** Find available flights by departure city, destination, and date.
- **Conversational CLI:** Simple, intuitive command-line chat interface.
- **Modular Tool System:** Easily extend or customize the agent to handle bookings, baggage, loyalty programs, and more.

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
=======
## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* Git
>>>>>>> 4a0d157812c8bda1bb7b36195ecc8459bc3aabab

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd airline_support_agent
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
.env\Scriptsctivate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

=======
### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

* **On macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
* **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.

>>>>>>> 4a0d157812c8bda1bb7b36195ecc8459bc3aabab
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
### 5. Add Environment Variables

- Create a `.env` file in the project root.
- Add your DashScope API key:
    ```env
    # Get your API key from:
    # https://bailian.console.alibabacloud.com/
=======
### 5. Configure Environment Variables

The agent requires an API key to connect to the language model service.

a.  Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
b.  Open the `.env` file and add your DashScope API key:

    ```env
    # Get your key from [https://bailian.console.alibabacloud.com/](https://bailian.console.alibabacloud.com/)
>>>>>>> 4a0d157812c8bda1bb7b36195ecc8459bc3aabab
    DASHSCOPE_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    ```

## Running the Agent

Start the agent with:
=======
## How to Run the Agent

Once the setup is complete, you can start the agent by running the `main.py` script from the root directory:
>>>>>>> 4a0d157812c8bda1bb7b36195ecc8459bc3aabab

```bash
python main.py
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
The CLI will launch—just type your questions. To exit, type `quit`.

---

## Example Queries

Ask the agent questions like:

```
What is the status of flight QA123?
Find me a flight from JFK to LAX for tomorrow.
Hi, can you help me?
```

---

## Extending the Agent

The modular design makes it easy to add new tools (e.g., for booking, baggage claims, etc.). See the `tools/` directory for examples.

---

## License
